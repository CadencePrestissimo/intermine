SRX193500	SAMN01760914		wandering thrid instar larval stage			fat body																																					wandering larvae		wandering larvae																															Ras-expressing	Ras-expressing																																										Fat body							offsprings of Bx Gal4 x UAS-RAS V12															fat body							Analysis of the humoral immune response against aberrant self by RNA sequencing of the fat body in Drosophila melanogaster	The early stages of the immune response against aberrant tissues such a tumors are technically difficult to study and therefore little understood. To analyze the innate immune response towards modified self-tissue we expressed a dominant-active version of the Ras oncogene in Drosophila imaginal discs and salivary glands. Signs of an immune response are observed on wings of adult flies, which show spots of melanization and in larvae, where the salivary glands attract blood cells. In line with the strong response mounted against salivary glands, they are found to express metalloproteases and apoptotic markers making them both accessible and recognizable for the immune system. The response against the glands bears several hallmarks of an encapsulation response including flattening of plasmatocytes, differentiation of lamellocytes, attachment of crystal cells and melanization at the final stage. RNA sequencing of the fat body, the primary producer of immune effectors, reveals a pattern of induced genes, which overlaps the one previously found upon wasp infestation but shows also several specific features. Evidence for the functional importance of one of the induced genes is presented proving the power of our approach to identify regulators of the response against modified self. Overall design: Transcriptome analysis of the immune response in the fat body after expression of  dominant-active RAS in the wing imaginal discs and salivary glands. Comparison of fat bodies from 3 control and 3 RAS-expressing larvae. For each sample fat bodies from 40 individuals were dissected.

A panel of wild-type- derived strains of Drosophila melanogaster was used to assay the transcriptional changes in response to mating. The data represents whole transcriptome profiling of female heads before (Virgin) and after mating (Mated). RNA-Seq data was generated for the F1-heterozygous progeny resulting from crosses between inbred wild-type- derived strains and a common tester strain w[1118].  Virgin females from naturally-derived strains were crossed to males of the w[1118] tester strain to generate hybrid virgin female progeny. Half of these hybrid females were assayed as virgins at age 10 days, whereas the other half were mated to w[1118] males at a ratio of 30 virgins to 10 males per vial for 24 hours at age 4 days, and then assayed at age 10 days. The analysis of RNA-Seq data revealed significant upregulation of hundreds of genes in response to mating across the various genotypes. Most of the upregulated genes are expressed in female fat body, indicating significant shifts in metabolic pathways of mated females. Interestingly, while the sets of differentially expressed genes were highly concordant across different populations and strains, considerable variation was observed in the average magnitudes of transcriptional changes.  This dataset was also used to characterize natural genetic variation in selected transcriptional traits, including allele-specific expression, splicing patterns and RNA-editing.

We also wanted to determine which analysis methods would be optimal for RNA-Seq data.  To meet these objectives, we performed transcriptional profiling of whole adult individuals from 16 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines.  We quantified differential expression among genotypes, environments, and sexes. Overall design: We randomly chose 16 DGRP lines for this experiment: DGRP-93, DGRP-229, DGRP-320, DGRP-352, DGRP-370, DGRP-563, DGRP-630, DGRP-703, DGRP-761, DGRP-787, DGRP-790, DGRP-804, DGRP-812, DGRP-822, DGRP-850, and DGRP-900. We collected 8 virgin male and 8 virgin female flies from the 16 DGRP genotypes in three replicated environments to produce RNA sequence profiles.  We controlled the environmental conditions in the following ways. We seeded the fly cultures with 5 male and 5 female parents.  We reared the progeny in a single incubator on standard Drosophila food (http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/Fly_Work/media-recipes/bloomfood.htm) at 25°C, 60% humidity, and a 12:12-hour light:dark  cycle.  We collected and maintained male and female virgins at 20 flies to a same-sex vial for four days prior to RNA extraction to control for social exposure.  Flies were frozen for RNA extraction at the same circadian time (1:00 pm) in 96-well plates.  PolyA RNA stranded libraries were prepared by modifying an existing protocol.  ERCC (External RNA Controls Consortium, SRM2374, beta version, pools 78A/78B) sequences were added during the library preparation as a control. For some samples >1 library was generated to check technical variation. We performed multiplexed single-end 76 bp sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000.  Reads were mapped to FlyBase release 5 version 57 and release 6 version 01 of the Drosophila melanogaster genome and the ERCC sequences.  Mapped reads were counted at the gene level.

Here, we show that PRC1 components act as neoplastic tumor suppressors independently of PRC2 function. By mapping the distribution of PRC1 components and the histone H3K27me3 mark, we identify genes that acquire PRC1 and H3K27me3 in larvae, and a much larger set of genes bound by PRC1 in the absence of H3K27me3 in larval tissues. These genes massively outnumber canonical targets and they are preeminently involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, signaling and polarity. Mutation in PRC1 components specifically deregulates this set of genes, whereas canonical targets are derepressed in both PRC1 and PRC2 mutants. In human ES cells, PRC1 components colocalize with H3K27me3 like in Drosophila embryos, whereas they are selectively recruited to a large set of proliferation and signaling-associated genes in differentiated cell types, showing that the redeployment of PRC1 components during development is evolutionarily conserved. Overall design: Comparative study of Polycomb group proteins and histon marks during development with ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data in eye discs and wing discs (L3 stage) in Drosophila

[RNA-seq]	Genome control is operated by transcription factors (TF) controlling their target genes by binding to promoters and enhancers. Conceptually, the interactions between TFs, their binding sites, and their functional targets are represented by gene regulatory networks (GRN). Deciphering in vivo GRNs underlying organ development in an unbiased genome-wide setting involves identifying both functional TF-gene interactions and physical TF-DNA interactions. To reverse-engineer the GRN of eye development in Drosophila, we performed RNA-seq across 72 genetic perturbations and sorted cell types, and inferred a co-expression network. Next, we derived direct TF-DNA interactions using computational motif inference, ultimately connecting 241 TFs to 5632 direct target genes through 24926 enhancers. Using this network we found network motifs, cis-regulatory codes, and new regulators of eye development. We validate the predicted target regions of Grainyhead by ChIP-seq and identify this factor as a general co-factor in the eye network, being bound to thousands of nucleosome-free regions. Overall design: RNA-seq gene expression profiling across Drosophila 3rd instar larval wild type tissues (brain, eye-antennal and wing discs), specific cell types from the eye-antennal disc, sorted by FACS, and genetic perturbations (TF mutants, TF over-expression, and TF RNAi knockdown).
